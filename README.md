# ELS-Plus-UI

ELS+ UI based on Emergency Lighting System 1.05 by Lt.Caine


### Prerequisites

* ELS-Plus (https://forum.fivem.net/t/beta-els-fic/7747)


### Installing

Replace the NUI folder in the ELS+ resource folder with the one provided. It is highly recommended you delete the pre-existing folder to avoid conflicts. It is also recommended to edit the ``__resource.lua`` file in the resources main directory and remove ``popper.js``, ``bootstrap.bundle.min.js``,  ``bootstrap-toggle.min.js``, ``bootstrap.min.css`` and ``bootstrap-toggle.min.css`` from the NUI area.
